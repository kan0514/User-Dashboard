üìà Full-Stack Personal Finance DashboardThis is a complete, full-stack web application designed for secure and efficient personal finance tracking and visualization.‚ú® Project OverviewThe dashboard provides users with secure access to their financial data, offering clear insights into spending habits, transaction history, and overall balance trends.ComponentStackKey FunctionalityFrontend (UI)Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSSData visualization, user interface, and authentication flow management.BackendNode.js (Express), Prisma, PostgreSQLSecure REST API, data persistence, and business logic.CachingRedis (Upstack Cache)Optimizes dashboard performance by caching frequently accessed data.üéØ FeaturesSecure Authentication: Robust user registration and login endpoints utilizing JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure, stateless authorization.Performance: Uses an external Redis cache instance to accelerate dashboard data retrieval.Data Visualization: A dynamic Bar Chart on the dashboard displays the running balance calculated over the last 10 transactions.Data Integrity: Transaction and Category data are seeded via specific Prisma scripts for a structured start.‚öôÔ∏è Setup and InstallationPrerequisitesEnsure you have the following installed:Node.js (LTS version)PostgreSQL Database InstanceGitAccess to a Redis instance (e.g., Upstack Online Cache).Global SetupClone the Repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/kan0514/User-Dashboard.git
cd User-Dashboard
üíª Backend SetupThe backend handles the API and database logic.1. Environment ConfigurationCreate a file named .env in the ./backend directory and populate it with your specific credentials:Bash# .env (in backend folder)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://[USER]:[PASSWORD]@localhost:5432/finance_db"
JWT_SECRET="YOUR_STRONG_RANDOM_SECRET_KEY"
REDIS_URL="redis://<your-upstack-url>:<port>" 
2. Install and InitializeBash# Navigate to backend
cd backend
npm install
3. Database Migration and SeedingYou must reset the database and run seed scripts in order to populate the initial Categories and Transactions.Bash# ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: This will drop and recreate all data!
npx prisma migrate reset 

# Run seed scripts in order: Categories -> [User Creation] -> Transactions
npx ts-node prisma/seedCategories.ts
# Run your user creation script here if separate, otherwise it's handled on initial login/register.
npx ts-node prisma/seedTransactions.ts
4. Run the API ServerBashnpm run dev
The API will be running on http://localhost:4000.üñ•Ô∏è Frontend Setup (UI)The frontend is a Next.js application located in the ./ui directory.1. Environment ConfigurationCreate a file named .env.local in the ./ui directory:Bash# .env.local (in ui folder)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/api/v1
2. Install DependenciesBash# Navigate to frontend
cd ../ui 
npm install
3. Run the Client ApplicationBashnpm run dev
The application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.üîó Key API EndpointsEndpointMethodAuthenticationPurpose/api/v1/auth/registerPOSTNoneCreate a new user account./api/v1/auth/loginPOSTNoneAuthenticate user and issue JWT./api/v1/dashboardGETBearer TokenRetrieve cached and aggregated financial data for the dashboard.üé® Frontend Architecture HighlightsGlobal State: The main user and dashboard data is managed in ui/app/layout.tsx and passed down, centralizing state management.Data Flow: The dashboard uses axios to fetch data, passing the JWT in the Authorization: Bearer <token> header.Visualization Logic: The SpendChart.tsx component handles the complex task of sorting transactions by date and calculating the running balance for accurate chart representation.
